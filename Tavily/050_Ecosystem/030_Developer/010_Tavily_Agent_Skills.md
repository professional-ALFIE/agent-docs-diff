### Step 1:

Install the Tavily CLI:

```bash theme={null}
curl -fsSL https://cli.tavily.com/install.sh | bash
```

See the [CLI docs](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/tavily-cli) for other installation methods.

### Step 2:

Install the skills:

```bash theme={null}
npx skills add tavily-ai/skills --all
```

```bash theme={null}
npx skills add tavily-ai/skills --skill tavily-search
```

After installation, restart your AI agent to load the skills.

## Usage

Once installed, skills are automatically available to your agent. No additional configuration is needed — your agent will use them when appropriate based on your prompts.

```

```
Crawl the Stripe API docs and save them locally
```

```
Research the competitive landscape for AI coding assistants
```

## Skill Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search" defaultOpen="true">
    Web search returning LLM-optimized results with content snippets and relevance scores.

    **Invoke explicitly:**

    ```
    /tavily-search
    ```

    **Example prompts:**

    * "Search for the latest news on AI regulations"
    * "/tavily-search current React best practices"
    * "Search for Python async patterns"

    **CLI usage:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Basic search
    tvly search "your query" --json

    # Advanced search with more results
    tvly search "quantum computing" --depth advanced --max-results 10 --json

    # Recent news
    tvly search "AI news" --time-range week --topic news --json

    # Domain-filtered
    tvly search "SEC filings" --include-domains sec.gov,reuters.com --json
    ```

    **Key options:** `--depth` (ultra-fast/fast/basic/advanced), `--max-results`, `--topic`, `--time-range`, `--include-domains`, `--exclude-domains`, `--include-raw-content`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Extract">
    Extract clean markdown or text content from one or more URLs. Handles JavaScript-rendered pages.

    **Invoke explicitly:**

    ```
    /tavily-extract
    ```

    **Example prompts:**

    * "Extract the content from this article URL"
    * "/tavily-extract [https://example.com/blog/post](https://example.com/blog/post)"
    * "Extract content from these three documentation pages"

    **CLI usage:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Single URL
    tvly extract "https://example.com/article" --json

    # Multiple URLs
    tvly extract "https://example.com/page1" "https://example.com/page2" --json

    # Query-focused extraction (returns relevant chunks only)
    tvly extract "https://example.com/docs" --query "authentication API" --chunks-per-source 3 --json
    ```

    **Key options:** `--query`, `--chunks-per-source`, `--extract-depth` (basic/advanced), `--format` (markdown/text)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Map">
    Discover URLs on a website without extracting content. Faster than crawling — useful for finding the right page before extracting.

    **Invoke explicitly:**

    ```
    /tavily-map
    ```

    **Example prompts:**

    * "Map the site structure of docs.example.com"
    * "Find the authentication page on this site"
    * "List all URLs under the /api/ path"

    **CLI usage:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Discover all URLs
    tvly map "https://docs.example.com" --json

    # With natural language filtering
    tvly map "https://docs.example.com" --instructions "Find API docs and guides" --json

    # Filter by path
    tvly map "https://example.com" --select-paths "/blog/.*" --limit 500 --json
    ```

    **Key options:** `--max-depth`, `--limit`, `--instructions`, `--select-paths`, `--exclude-paths`

    <Tip>Use the **map + extract** pattern: map to find the right page, then extract its content. This is often more efficient than crawling an entire site.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Crawl">
    Crawl websites and extract content from multiple pages. Save each page as a local markdown file or get structured JSON output.

    **Invoke explicitly:**

    ```
    /tavily-crawl
    ```

    **Example prompts:**

    * "Crawl the Stripe API docs and save them locally"
    * "/tavily-crawl [https://docs.example.com](https://docs.example.com)"
    * "Download the Next.js documentation for offline reference"

    **CLI usage:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Save each page as a markdown file
    tvly crawl "https://docs.example.com" --output-dir ./docs/

    # Semantic focus (returns relevant chunks, not full pages)
    tvly crawl "https://docs.example.com" --instructions "Find authentication docs" --chunks-per-source 3 --json

    # Filter to specific paths
    tvly crawl "https://example.com" --select-paths "/api/.*,/guides/.*" --exclude-paths "/blog/.*" --json
    ```

    **Key options:** `--max-depth`, `--limit`, `--instructions`, `--chunks-per-source`, `--output-dir`, `--select-paths`, `--exclude-paths`

    ```
    /tavily-research
    ```

    **Example prompts:**

    * "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
    * "/tavily-research AI agent frameworks and save to report.json"
    * "Research the competitive landscape for AI coding assistants"

    **CLI usage:**
